The services by default use publically available services. The QA and dev services can be used instead
by setting the environment variable PYGDP_TIER to either 'testing' or 'development'.

pyGDP_client.py
===============

Main example to showcase pyGDP workflow and pyGDP.webProcessingObject functions. 
Uses pyGDP's main tool the submitFeatureWeightedGrid statistics algorithm. 
(Note: this example is not how production pyGDP should actually be implemented).


pyGDP_featureCategoricalGridCoverage.py
=======================================

A short example to request a file using the 
submitfeatureCategoricalGridCoverage algorithm.


pyGDP_featureCoverageOPenDAP_script.py
======================================

A similarly short example making a request and downloading 
an example file using the submitFeatureCoverageOPenDAP algorithm.


pyGDP_featureCoverageWCSintersection_script.py
==============================================

Another example of the submitFeatureCoverageWCSintersection function.


pyGDP_featureWeighted_multi_vars_stats.py
=========================================

Another example using the FWGS (FeatureWeightedGridStatistics algorithm) 
this time utilizing multiple data types and statistics.


pyGDP_featureWeighted_script_1.py
=================================

An example of choosing datasets through pyGDP, then selecting a data type 
from that dataset for FWGS calculations. Text listings of both the datasets 
and datatypes can be generated with pyGDP to make things easier on the user.


pyGDP_featureWeighted_script_2.py
=================================

An example using specific values of attributes from a shapefile 
that already exists on the GDP server.


pyGDP_featureWeighted_script_3.py
=================================

An example of some of the other user-friendly listing that can be completed by pyGDP; 
including values, data types, and time ranges; all of which eventually define the FWGS request.


pyGDP_featureWeighted_script_4.py
=================================

An example showing a call being made without any listing or searching of FWGS variables.


pyGDP_featureWeighted_script_NTYD.py
====================================

An example utilizing the uploadShapefile function to upload a test file 
to GDP before submitting a request of FWGS using that file.


pyGDP_wicci_featureWeighted_example_script.py
=============================================

An example to show  how to search for a particular dataset and loop through 
a list of OPeNDAP resources associated with it.
