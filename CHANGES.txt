Changes 
=======
2.1.2
---------------
- Updated to latest OWSLib
- Working on py3K support
- PEP 8 style updates
- Documentation updates
- New job monitoring capability
2.1.1
---------------
HTTPS
This release updates the package to use the now required HTTPS on .gov urls.

2.0.1
---------------
Bug Fix Release
Changes to support transition of GDP to HTTPS only services.

2.0.0
---------------
Support for OWSLib 0.9.2
Refactor to support OWSLib 0.9.2.
Minor changes to API that are backwards incompatible.
 - The anyText argument for getDataSetURI now expects None or a list of keyword strings rather than a string. By default anyText is None.

1.3.3
---------------
- Changed CSW catalog to ScienceBase
- Removed bioclim algorithm from pygdp.py and disabled test.

1.3.2
---------------
- Added a requirements specifically for running tests.
- Bug fix on _generateFeatureRequest function.

1.3.1
---------------

- Improved log level control. If pyGDP methods are run in verbose mode, the terminal log handler is set to INFO level rather than ERROR.
- Implemented ability to change filename and recheck interval in the top-level pyGDP methods.
- Reorganized package into sub-modules instead of sub-packages.
- docstrings should bubble up to ‘wrapper’ methods in pyGDP.py

1.3.0-dev (2014-10-10)
---------------

- New testing framework implemented. Lettuce behavior driven development framework now wraps the nose testing framework.
- Substantial refactor to reorganize the package into logical sub packages. Backward compatibility was maintained as much as possible. 
- Improved installation instructions and installation utilities.
- Examples updated.
- Dataset availability caused some tests to be permanently broken.
- Incorporated a function to execute the bioClim WPS algorithm.
- Incorporated some better exception handling.  
- Implemented some basic logging which requires the latest owslib.


1.2.2 (2013-06-25)
---------------

- Implemented attribute and attribute value handling for ArcGIS-Server. As of the release of this functionality, debugging of the core-GDP is ongoing for the ArcGIS Server WFS payload.

1.2.1 (2013-05-16)
---------------

- Now allow startTime and endTime to be None. This is helpful if you want all time steps, the default behavior given no time, or if you want to access a dataset with no timesteps.
- Implemented a check for dodsC in urls and switch http to odds if that is the case for all urls that go through featureweightedgridstatistics.

1.2.0 (2013-04-23)
---------------

- Several improvements to install/setup details.
- CSW search implemented for getDatasetURIs. 'title, abstract, [uri1, uri2, ...]' is response format.
- urls returned from CSW search that contain dodsC have http replaced with dods.
- Examples and tests expanded and fixed up substantially.
- Network and other errors while checking process status are excepted up to ten times before failure.
- Improvement to FeatureWeightedGridStatistics algorithm, now implements correct multiplicity for all inputs.
- Fixed up _getFeatureCollectionGeoType to work more predictably and protect from naive requests.
- In all algorithms, value=None now returns a feature collection that returns all values, otherwise explicit gmlIDs or values are required.
- Now catching invalid shapefile attribute values and raising an exception when they are not found.

1.1.1 (2013-01-10)
---------------

- Versioning applied at 1.1.1, project well underway, still a work in progress.
- Basic functionality in place to get input parameters and execute all GDP algorithms.
